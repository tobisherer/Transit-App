# Transit-App
Lessons learned:
- Started out overwhelmed, don't do that.  Got too deep with what I didn't know.
- Should've just started at the beginning.  Wasted a couple of precious hours.
- Hamstrung by not using another development environment outside of what I do at work.
- Not used to working outside of strict requirements and guidelines given by customer.
- Big learning curve, but definitely attainable.  I'll be finishing this.
- Much easier to work with a team.  Good to bounce ideas off of each other and to encourage.
- Much more enjoyable to work with a team.
- Need more experience with Java.
- Need more hours in my day to learn all the fun and cool stuff that I've been missing out on.

Good things:
- Learned how to work with GitHub
- Found my limitations and some weaknesses, so I can get to work on them now.
- Discovered different ways to start building an app
- Learned A LOT!

Did what I could with extremely limited time, previous engagements, strict work schedule with tight, looming deadlines. 
My hope is to show my ability to problem solve, to not give up, to learn as I go.  
Prayful that the potential is enough to move on to the next step. 
Eager to learn, even if it's on my own.  Ready to continue personal and professional growth.
